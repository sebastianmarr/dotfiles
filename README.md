# Sebastian Marr Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.


## Installation

	git clone git://github.com/mimbotastic/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
	cd ~/.dotfiles
	rake install


## Environment

I am running Mac OS X, but it will likely work on Linux as well with 
minor fiddling. I only use zsh, so bash config is very basic. For zsh, the projects zsh-completion and zsh-syntax-highlighting are included as submodules. They will be cloned as well during installation.

## Acknowledgements

Forked from Ryan Bates. Thanks for the idea!
