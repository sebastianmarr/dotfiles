# Sebastian Marr dotfiles

These are config files to set up a command line environment the way I like it.

## Prerequisites

The dotfiles are installed via [GNU stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow). Install it with the package manager of your choice.
Use of zsh heavily recommended.

## Installation

	git clone git://github.com/sebastianmarr/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
	cd ~/.dotfiles
    stow zsh
    stow bash
    # etc...

Just stow every configuration you need.
