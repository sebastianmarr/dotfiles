= Ryan Bates Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.


== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/mimbotastic/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install


== Environment

I am running on Mac OS X, but it will likely work on Linux as well with 
minor fiddling. I only use zsh.

== Acknowledgement

Forked from Ryan Bates. Thanks for the idea!
